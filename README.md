This repository contains a demonstration of a subtle memory access overflow bug in assembly language. The `bug.asm` file shows the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.asm` provides a corrected version.  The bug is triggered when the value of `esi` is sufficiently large to cause an address calculation overflow. This highlights the importance of careful memory management in low-level programming.
